# kanji_inkyphat

## Introduction

A simple python script scrape www.kanji-a-day.com using BeautifulSoup and display it on a inkypHAT

## Installation

`pip3 -i requirements.txt`
and then add into crontab to run every few hours to keep it rolling through the kanji :)

## Limitations

I've got the red/black/white inkypHAT, need to add args to allow passing through of other inky's
